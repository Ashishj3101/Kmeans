This project demonstrates the application of the K-Means Clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique for grouping data into clusters. The dataset is synthetically generated using the make_blobs function, which creates data points around known cluster centers, making it ideal for clustering tasks.

The project includes the following steps:

Data generation using make_blobs.
Clustering with K-Means to identify distinct groups in the data.
Visualization of the clusters and their centroids.
Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
